Workspace
=========

A simple, generic workspace container for javascript applications.

Alpine based container image for developing javascript applications. Includes:

- nodejs
- npm
- node-sass

(We should probably remove node-sass — it isn’t always required, and this image is intended to be extended with project specific requirements.)
